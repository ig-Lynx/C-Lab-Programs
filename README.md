# C-Lab-Programs (1st year)

List of the Lab Program's
1. Simulation of a Simple Calculator
2. Compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages.
3. An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit:beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are     
   charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, number of 
   units consumed and print out the charges.
4. Write a C Program to display the following by reading the number of rows as input,
          1
        1 2 1
      1 2 3 2 1
    1 2 3 4 3 2 1
   
5. Implement Binary Search on Integers
6. Implement Matrix multiplication and validate the rules of multiplication
7. Compute sin(x)/cos(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in library function. Print both the results with appropriate inferences.
8. Sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort.
9. Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, and find string length. Use the parameter passing techniques.
10. Implement structures to read, write and compute average- marks of the students, list the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.
11. Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of N real numbers.
12. Write a C program to copy a text file to another, read both the input file name and target file name.
